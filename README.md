# StaffManagementSystem

## Project Overview:
This project involves developing a console-based application in Java, focusing on Object-
Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application will serve as a Staff Management
System, enabling users to manage employee data for a company.
## Key Objectives:
- Implement OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and
abstraction.
- Create a user-friendly console interface.
* Ensure data persistence by reading and writing employee data to/from a CSV/JSON
file.
## Employee Data Management:
 Add Employee: Input employee details (ID, name, department, role, salary) and
add them to the system.
 Edit Employee: Modify existing employee details.
 Fire Employee: Flag that the employee doesn’t work at the company anymore.
 List Employees: Display a list of all active employees with their details.
## Data Persistence:
 Read Data: Initialize the system with employee data from a CSV/JSON file.
 Write Data: Save current employee data to a CSV/JSON file upon exit.
 Search Functionality: Search for employees by name, ID, or department.
## Technical Requirements:
 Employee and other relevant classes encapsulating respective properties and
methods.
 Define interfaces for common functionalities.
 Use abstract classes where appropriate.
## File Handling:
 Implement CSV/JSON file operations for data persistence.
## Exception Handling:
 Robust error and exception management for user inputs and file operations.
Data Structures:
 Use appropriate collections (like Lists, Maps) to manage and organize data.
## Documentation:
 Comprehensive documentation of classes, methods, and logic flow.
 Source Code: Well-organized and commented Java source files.
